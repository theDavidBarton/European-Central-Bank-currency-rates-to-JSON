# European Central Bank currency rates to JSON

European Central Bank's currency rates in JSON (fetched and transformed from the original XML feed)

## Background

The European Central Bank (ECB) [provides up-to-date currency rates](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/) for 32 currencies around the world (the base is EUR). As ECB publishes this information solely in XML format the following ES6 script can be useful **for frontend applications** to get the data in the more convinient JSON.

The script contains two async functions where the first one queries the XML feed with the native Fetch API (to avoid CORS warnings the great: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ service is in use here üôè -- will need to be replaced a hosted version of CORS anywhere in the future as it has rate limit! ‚òùÔ∏è), and the second transforms the relevant XML attribute values to an easy-to-use JSON (OK, it returns a JS object, you need to stringify it if you really need JSON)

## Usage

```javascript
transformRatesToJSON()
```

Use it with promises (or with async/await syntax as below) to get the rates for the specific currencies. Like for US dollar: `rates.USD`. _Note:_ ECB - not like other APIs based on their data - doesn't use rate limits, however their service isn't fast, try to call this function as few places as possibble and store the JSON for later usage.
See other details in 'Background' section above.

```javascript
async function exampleUsage() {
  let rates = await transformRatesToJSON()
  console.log(rates.USD)
}
exampleUsage()
// output: 1.1065
```
